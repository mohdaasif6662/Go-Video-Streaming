## Usage

Once the server is running, you can access the HLS stream using a media player that supports HLS, such as VLC or any web-based player.

### Example URL

You can use the following URL format to access your streams:

```
http://localhost:8080/stream/{your-stream-name}/playlist.m3u8
```

Replace `{your-stream-name}` with the name of your stream.
